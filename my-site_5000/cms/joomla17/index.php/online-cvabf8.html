				<h4>
					Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					My name is Wittawat Keawcharoen. I&#39;m an experienced graphic programmer and &nbsp;a graphic enthusiast, with a huge passion in Game development. I work full time as a rendering engineer for Ubisoft, Reflections Studio, in Newcastle.</p>
				<div>
					I&rsquo;m an excellent programmer as a top of the class with a good number of years in the Game Industry and shipped AAA Titles.&nbsp;I have experienced working on most of the modern consoles, XBOX360/Kinect, PS3 and PC Direct3D 9/10. Currently I&rsquo;m accelerating myself into DirectX 11, spending my day-to-day experimenting with their new features and rendering pipeline, preparing for the next-gens.&nbsp;</div>
				<p>
					I have plenty of experience traveling and working in collaboration, both in and out of the game industry with other studios around the world, which I have gained good skills of adaptation and effective communication. Through different projects, I also have been given opportunities to work with many in-house game engines on many aspects. Not only on the game itself, but also&nbsp;Tools and Third parties APIs.</p>
				<p>
					In Total, I am a software engineer with over 7 years experience. Previously, I was an Educator working for my university, a Team Leader in the manufacturing industry in my native Thailand where I was in charge of a small team of coders. This gained me some valuable management experience and I would say this helped me to understand how to work better as part of a team.</p>
				<p>
					About myself, I am a very friendly person and a real team player. At the studio, I&rsquo;m so called, &quot;that funny guy&quot;, who always bring smiles and energy to the team. Like a classic motto, I really play Hard but also work Hard too. I love to discuss and take initiative in bringing new interesting technology, and methods into development. I like spending time with Artists and Game designers learning and exchanging the idea about their professions.</p>
				<p>
					I strongly believe that Video Game is the creation of Arts, and all sorts of creative activities are somehow connected. This is the reason why I&rsquo;m interested in all other type of creativities&nbsp;as well. I am a Guitar player, and I can create my own Music. I am also interested in Fine arts, Modern arts, Japanese stuffs, cooking, Drawing, Manga and etc.</p>
				<div>
					With my little spare time left, I use it on some voluntary works with young people. About my contribution, I do teaching Music and talking about Game Development at schools from time to time.</div>
