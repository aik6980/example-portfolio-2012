				<h4>
					Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					My name is Wittawat Keawcharoen. I&#39;m an experienced graphic programmer and &nbsp;a graphic enthusiast, with a huge passion in Game development. I work full time as a rendering engineer for Ubisoft, Reflections Studio, in Newcastle.</p>
				<div>
					I&rsquo;m an excellent programmer as a top of the class with a good number of years in the Game Industry and shipped AAA Titles.&nbsp;I have experienced working on most of the modern consoles, XBOX360/Kinect, PS3 and PC Direct3D 9/10. Currently I&rsquo;m accelerating myself into DirectX 11, spending my day-to-day experimenting with their new features and rendering pipeline, preparing for the next-gens.&nbsp;</div>
				<p>
					I have plenty of experience traveling and working in collaboration, both in and out of the game industry with other studios around the world, which I have gained good skills of adaptation and effective communication. Through different projects, I also have been given opportunities to work with many in-house game engines on many aspects. Not only on the game itself, but also&nbsp;Tools and Third parties APIs.</p>
				<p>
					In Total, I am a software engineer with over 7 years experience. Previously, I was an Educator working for my university, a Team Leader in the manufacturing industry in my native Thailand where I was in charge of a small team of coders. This gained me some valuable management experience and I would say this helped me to understand how to work better as part of a team.</p>
				<p>
					About myself, I am a very friendly person and a real team player. At the studio, I&rsquo;m so called, &quot;that funny guy&quot;, who always bring smiles and energy to the team. Like a classic motto, I really play Hard but also work Hard too. I love to discuss and take initiative in bringing new interesting technology, and methods into development. I like spending time with Artists and Game designers learning and exchanging the idea about their professions.</p>
				<p>
					I strongly believe that Video Game is the creation of Arts, and all sorts of creative activities are somehow connected. This is the reason why I&rsquo;m interested in all other type of creativities&nbsp;as well. I am a Guitar player, and I can create my own Music. I am also interested in Fine arts, Modern arts, Japanese stuffs, cooking, Drawing, Manga and etc.</p>
				<div>
					With my little spare time left, I use it on some voluntary works with young people. About my contribution, I do teaching Music and talking about Game Development at schools from time to time.</div>

<h4>
	Music and Cooking</h4>
<p>
	Outside my coding hours, I also put myself into a few different creation activities. I love playing guitar, and usually find time for a practice session everyday. I also try pushing myself to learn Music theory to be able to better express my own creativity.</p>
<p>
	I like listening a wide range of music, 80s, Japanese pop to Rock/Metal until Jazz and Classical music, even the Video Game music. If I have to pick my favorite one, I prefer Smooth Inspirational Jazz at the top. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Cooking is another one of my things. Learning the theory behind each type of ingredient is very much fun, and it can be surprisingly scientific too. I often pick one or two new materials on my shopping day and try to come up with a new recipe. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h4>
	Internet and Games</h4>
<p>
	I don&#39;t have TV for a very long time now, but the Internet has already been a very good source to keep me up to date. I love watching Documentary, and luckily there are plenty you can find them online.</p>
<p>
	Even it is not as much as before, I still play games, read Japanese Manga&nbsp;and American comics. Personally, they sometimes are the best resources for me to stay sharp, help keeping my imagination on the edge and be able to think outside of the box.</p>
<h4>
	Charity/Voluntary Work</h4>
<p>
	With my little spare time left, I use it for some voluntary works with young people. About my contribution, I do teaching Music and talking about Game Development at schools from time to time.</p>
<p>
	I joined this program&nbsp;because I want to be able to give some back to our society, and share more than just games. As a game developer, I would like to use my profession to help inspiring, mentoring and encouraging our children. I hope this would be benefit for their future somehow. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	... As much as I love turn things into experiments and challenges, this somehow become my favorite quote ...</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		Failure is always an option ;-)<br />
		- Mythbusters</p>
</blockquote>
