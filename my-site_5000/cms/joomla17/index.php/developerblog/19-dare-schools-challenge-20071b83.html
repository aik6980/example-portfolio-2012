<p>First of all, I've finished adding <a href="http://my-site:5000/cms/joomla17/index.php/component/content/7-projects/personal-works?layout=blog&amp;Itemid=17">the Photo Album section</a> into the website. The photobook is my plan since I started building this website, in order to make the web content doesn't look very academic intense. Not only that, You might be able to know me better through the pictures.<br />Secondly, I want to say something about my first job in UK. Even it just only two weeks long, honestly, It made myself exactly sure that I'm walking on the right path to be a game programmer.</p>
 
<p>Mainly, I need to help 36 students who join the event creating their game using Flash. By the time, we need to give them some idea about the media production as well. During a week period, we have a lot of fun together, event I found out some of them are desperated when they can't solve their problem. Anyway, that's how we work! stay on pressure. After two weeks, they got their first own game running. I can spotted how happy they are and some of them are already motivated to move on. I believe I will see some guys(gals) in Abertay next term. I highly recommend you to check out their games. I have put <a href="http://my-site:5000/cms/joomla17/index.php/component/content/7-projects/personal-works/20-june-22-2007-dare-schools-challenge07?Itemid=21">the winner and runner-up game</a> into the photo page, you won't believe the school kids performance.</p></div>
