<p>
	<strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>
	SN-DBS slashes compile times by distributing your source code builds between cooperating PCs on your local area network. This is my experience of using SNDBS for PS3, based on version 2.2</p>
 
<p>
	Recently, I have an opportunity to learn how to write some script in order to control SNDBS system for distributing tasks of my simple tool. Unlike Incredibuild, SNDBS is normally parted of the PS3 development package. If you are licensed for PS3, you will get to use this SNDBS for free.</p>
<h4>
	Distributing with SNDBS</h4>
<p>
	SNDBS is quite simple in the sense, you need 2-3 files (one of them could be created automatically) in order to setup the build,</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Configuration file :<br />
		This file contains the information about your tool, input patterns, return result patterns and etc. This is for SNDBS to setup the temporary environment on the remote machines.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Makefile&nbsp;:<br />
		The rule file uses to build your data.</li>
	<li>
		SNDBS&nbsp;script file : (Created by the Makefile)<br />
		Precompiled commands to help SNDBS foresee task parallelism.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
	It is fairly easy to integrate if your build scripts aren&#39;t very complex. There are a few ways you could start distributing tasks as following</p>
<p>
	1. Manually integrate your build command into dbsbuild command line</p>
<p>
	hard coding commands is a very simple form, but least flexible.</p>
<p>
	2. Using the Makefile as the build command injector</p>
<p>
	if your tool can be build using the GNU Make utility, it could be pass to the SNDBS and everything is working magically. You also can test your Makefile locally and (almost) exactly it will work on the distributed system too</p>
<p>
	This sounds like a good way, however, most of Makefile is relied on the &quot;Recursive&quot; mechanism and this can easily confused the SNDBS. The worst result is that your build script will end up running in an almost serial tasks!</p>
<p>
	3. Using the Makefile to precompile your build commands</p>
<p>
	With a little bit more work, by far this gave me the best result in term of parallelism. The idea is to precompile your build command using the Make Utility, then store them into the text file (this is an SNDBS script).</p>
<p>
	This gave SNDBS a chance to do some calculation and foresee their best distribution in order to maximize the parallelism.</p>
<h4>
	Maximize the workers</h4>
<p>
	Setting a proper CPU cores available in the Broker configuration could help you get the maximum usage of your resources.</p>
<p>
	A little tip is to set the number to the total number of CPU cores of your build farm, 2xCores on any HyperThreading machines &nbsp;</p>
<h4>
	Notes</h4>
<p>
	- It is quite a let down that you actually cannot monitor any progression of your sub task, which could be very useful to visualize your tool how they are distributed.</p>
<h4>
	Some problems I still have no idea why?</h4>
<p>
	- SNDBS could go unpredictable if there are lots of printf() on TTY? &nbsp;</p>
