  I learnt a valueable lesson about code debugging few days ago. To be honestly, who should have think that a small php script will cause me a whole website migration? <br/>
   
  It started where I decided to write a small function to help me pick up the best image from the articles for the headline. This funtion is very simple, we go through and find all images inside an article and sort them by sizes and name keywords. It is simple enough which I can get it working from the first time, but I found somehow this is somegow affect dratically to the overall page loading time. <br/>
  Here the nightmare begin ... <br/>
  <br/>
  I started commenting out some code and try to see if there is any improvements. Experimenting code on the shared-server is a "very bad" idea, and I'm about to tell you why. Somehow I commented out the wrong piece of code that make the function stuck in the infinite loop, 20-30 sec afterwards, my account was frozen because the server thought I'm a spammer (which I apogolizingly admitted that the code is acting like one ..) No worries, I could call an admin and hopefully he should be able to unlock my account and submit my fix, I believed ... <br/>
  I called him in the morning, and suddenly find out that is noone take care of the hosting anymore, and that is the moment I realize that I'm loosing my work on that server forever.
</p>

<p>
  What I have learnt from this story? First, backing up your work every a few weeks, and make sure you do a full backup at least every month. <br/>
  If you are using the small (propably free) service, make sure you have spoken to the admin occasionally and check if he still alive and ready to help you recover your website when it is an emergency state! <br/>
  Experimenting is surely help you increase your coding experience. However, it is very important to debugging your code throughly on the "local" server and make sure it is working unharmly before any submissions. On the shared server, the bad php code is an evil which also could effect other users and could turn a little innocent guy into a spammer. I'm sure there is no administrators in any IT world like it <br/>
