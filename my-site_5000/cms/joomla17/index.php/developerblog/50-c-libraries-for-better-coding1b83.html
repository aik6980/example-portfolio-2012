<div class="art-article"><h4>C++ Boost Library</h4>
<p>The current version of standard C++ was finalized inn 1998. The language offers robust support for traditional procedural programming as well as object-oriented and generic programming.<br />The integration of the standard template library (STL) in the mid-1990s represent as much a paradigm shift as did Bjarne Stroustrup's adding classes to C in the early 80s. Now that the majority of C++ programmers are proficient with concepts of STL, it's once again time to raise the bar</p>
 
<p> </p>
<p>Applications of the power of C++ are still being discovered. Many of today's C+++ libraries, and mathematical libraries in particular, take routine advantage of "Meta programming", a fortuitous but unforseen result of the brilliant design of C++ templates.</p>
<p>It is difficult to overstate the importance of Boost to the world of C++. Since the ratification of C++98, no entity outside of the ISO committee for standard C++ (WG21) has done more to influence the direction of C++ than has Boost. Boost, has thousands of experienced programmers, in peer-reviewd fashion, developed many useful library solutions not provided by C++98. Ten of its offeringhave already been acceptedto be integrated into the upcoming C++0x (new 2000 C++ Standard) library, and more are under consideration.</p>
<p>Offering the wide variety of useful functions, Boost provides programmers the huge C++ enhancements. For examples, Boost.Tokenizer, Boost.Regex or Boost.Spirit could be used in a sophiscicated text processing. Boost has been designed to make C++ more entertaining. Boost.Bind will amaze you its function projection and composition capabilities. Not only that, Boost also has a nice collection of mathematic function, including Quaternion, Octonion and Graphs.</p>
<p>In my opinion. learning Boost is not only help you develop your program faster, Boost components also give us a better understanding of C++ STL. In-depth tutorial of Boost could be determine as a foretaste of the future version of C++!</p>
