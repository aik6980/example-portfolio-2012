<div class="art-article"><p>This week, apart from the daily research routine, I also practically start learning DirectX10 programming. As we already knew, the DX10 architecture has been completely recreated, and most of the D3DX utillity function has been removed from the core package as well.</p><p>By then, it took me sometimes to realize those function hasn't been completely vanished, but they have been moved into DXUT library. [ oh well, thanks DirectX team :( .. ]</p><p>I'm not going to say how I integrate the DXUT with my framework, but it's working eventually. One huge restriction that DX10 users have to concern is that DXUT code is strictly using UNICODE or WCHAR, so be prepare if your app is MultiByte-based since it will not working at all.</p><p>What does the DXUT provide? Is it worth to change all your code to support UNICODE just only that package?</p><p>The answer is unclear. Anyway, here's the list of DXUT functionallity roughly,</p><ul><li>SDKMESH file loader, X file loader</li><li><strike>predefined DX10 intialization</strike></li><li><strike>predefined Camera</strike></li><li>etc.  </li></ul><p>As far as I concerned in my app, since I'm not using the whole DXUT package so most of the DX10 wrapper are busted apart from the 3DModel Loader (Nice!). Anyway, DXUT is the open-source library, so I still benefit from learning their (DirectX people) code organization.</p><p>Note here, I should remind myself about the presentation that going to be placed on next Monday, and here's the update</p><ul><li>Worksheet#3 has been done, still waiting for the feedback</li><li>Draft presentation is ready for my supervisor</li><li>Start working on Worksheet#4</li><li>Have a introductory chat with Andy (and his PS3 chains!)</li><li>Will have a chat with Ruth, Matt and Henry</li><li>Should star writing the project schedule (MS project) </li></ul>So far, it seems like my plan still on its schedule, but it can't be ignore by a sec. Hopefully, I'm not going to be distracted by other coursework, and the Instancing demo will be up by the middle of December.   <p>&nbsp;</p> </div>
