<div class="art-article"><h4>Quadtree</h4>
<p>After we realize that our application's performance has been suffered from the CPU bound problem. We want to reduce the number of CPU simulation by reducing the unnecessary tests and operations. The Quadtree is a spatial data structure that can be used for broad phase collission detection where we want to classify the visible set of object.</p>
<p>Quadtree is a tree-like structure which is very popular in a scene-query operation because it can discard the number of invisible obejcts pretty fast, especially on our scene which almost every object could be grouped together into a set of square tiles.</p>
<p>Considering benefits from the Visible Culling Operation, we could suppress all the animation in the invisible objects and also not passing them to the LoD selection process.</p>
<h4>Rain simulation</h4>

<p>Rendering the hundreds of thousands rain particles is an another example of a "massive" number of objects. Traditionally, particles simulation is calculated on the CPU. In this experiment, we would like to explore how to perform a Particle system simulation on the GPU by using the new section on the shader model 4.0 pipeline</p>
<h4>Geometry Shader</h4>
<p>Particle system computation has traditionally been performed on the CPU with the GPU rendering the particles as point sprites for visualization. With Geometry Shaders, the ability to output arbitrary amounts of data to a stream allows the GPU to create new geometry and to store the result of computations on existing geometry.</p>
<p>The plan is to use the stream out capabilities of the geometry shader to store the results of particles calculations into a buffer. Additionally, the Geometry Shader controls particle birth and death by either outputting new geometry to the stream or by avoiding writing existing geometry to the stream. A Geometry Shader that streams output to a buffer must be constructed differently from a normal Geometry Shader.</p>
<h4>Rendering Particles</h4>
<p>After the particles are advanced by the gsStreamOut Geometry Shader, the buffer that just received the output is used in a second pass for rendering the particles as point sprites. The Vertex Shader takes care of assigning size and color to the particles based upon their type and age. The Geometry Shader constructs point sprites from the points by emitting a 2 triangle strip for every point that is passed in. In this pass, the Geometry Shader output is passed to the rasterizer and does not stream out to any buffer.</p>
