I'm not quite sure how to spell his fullname, and it will be a bad idea to blindly type it here so I will call him Mr.D.
<p>Mr.D is so awesome! and since I'm so crazy about the game graphic programming, this makes his lecture is uberly useful to me, both of the honours project and personal research PoV.</p>
<p>Briefly, the whole lecture was about the advance full-screen effect, which most of them have already become a standard in modern game applications.<br />Personally, the full-screen effcet is not a new thing to me. I did implement them quite a few times into my past works (Direct3D, GroupProject). I found his lecture's real benefits are where he strongly confirmed most of my understanding are correct. =D</p>
<p>I also noted down some programming tips as following</p>
<ul>
<li>Offline ambient occlusion is still the best solution for most games.<br />around 32-64 rays have been casted from different angles in the offline-authoring tool<br />(Will ask Martin about this!)</li>
<li>Imposters are rendered using the key-color (like below sprite-based image) to exclude the unwanted project area. It use no-blending at all!</li>
<li>Imposters could be a few frames of animation, which the texture atlas technique could be used to store images in spatial-struture form (quad-tree)</li>
<li>Transparency is still a major problem on many effect such as fog.<br />It might sounds expensive, but we could render them again after the effect has been done to make sure we had the correct destination color while blending.</li>
<li>Imposters should be generated with the depth-texture</li>
<li>The great example for "partial-glow" is TRON2.0 the game</li>
<li>Deferred rendering (like deferred shading?) heavily used the fullscreen buffer, and it's memory-bound</li>
</ul> </div>
