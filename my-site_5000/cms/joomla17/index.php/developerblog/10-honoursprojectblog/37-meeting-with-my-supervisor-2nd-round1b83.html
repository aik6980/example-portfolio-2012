<div class="art-article"><p>this is another official meeting with Matt, my project supervisor. The meeting took place in the Cafe area in the union, where we can pick a nice cup of coffee (we both love the coffee break meeting style, so we decided to keep it on like this =D). </p><p>Mainly, we has been going through some general topics about my project plan. I updated my project status, and told him about some research papers, and my DirectX10 framework. According to this, I also asked about the detail and questions that I should prepare for the coming presentation.</p> <p>Next, I explained the project plan, which has been divided into the 3-4 phases. Since the project question could be able to answer from the different angles on many approaches, then I could prioritize the techniques that are most relevants. This should be able to protect myself not to overwhelm the project with too many techniques at the same time.</p><p>Here's a brief project plan, </p><ol><li>Phase 0, Reseach the available techniques and create the game framework. Mainly on DirectX10 programming and Shader 4.0 architecture</li><li>Phase 1, Create the demo that represent the "geometry instancing technique", defined in "GPU Gems 2"<br />Phase 1.1, Move further into the new "geometry instancing technique for Shader 4.0 Model", defined in "GPU Gems 3"</li><li>Phase 2, Smart LoD System and scene management<br />Static Imposter<br />Animated Imposter<br />Phase 2 (optional), "Can we use Geometry Shader to accelerate the imposter rendering?"</li><li>Phase 3, (optional), Use multi-threaded programming technique, in order to maximize the utilization on Multi-core CPU. </li></ol><p>The last bit of the meeting is where we discussed about the presentation. The planning part look fine so far, as long as I make it short and straight to the point. </p><p>Somehow, Matt did raise some interesting issues that I should prepare to answer,</p><ul><li>"The instancing technique has been made into the last year dissertation, what does make this project interesting?"<br />"Why DirectX10?"<br /><br />DirectX10 introduces the new API which is designed to be able to incooperate more efficiently on the Multi-core CPU and Shader 4.0 Model.<br />Moreover, there's also the new geometry instancing technique that is specially used the Shader4.0 features (Texture Array, Vertex Shader's Lookup Textures). This is the Phase 1 target.<br /><br />In conclusion, the project will be able to show, how we could improve the instancing technique, on the modern machine (SM4.0 eg. GeForce8Series)       </li></ul></div>
