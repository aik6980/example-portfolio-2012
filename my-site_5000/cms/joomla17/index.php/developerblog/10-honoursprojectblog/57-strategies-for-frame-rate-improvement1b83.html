<p style="text-align: left;">Geometry instancing has been proved itself which is an essential technique for increasing the GPU utilization. However, when the scene is contained the huge number of objects (let say 100k or above), it usually shows the dropping of GPU utilization. This is because, we spend time during a frame updating the objects in the CPU main loop instead of passing jobs to GPU for rendering.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In order to yield the best GPU utilization, we want the GPU to be busy all the time. In our situation, we already did by batching large number of objects before stream into the rendering pipeline.<br />Even regardless of game-play logics, there's still some render-related expensive operation, for example Character Animation. Here we have listed some possible solution which we're going to explore in order to improve our application frame rate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using "needToUpdate" flag could help us go through the loop much faster where some objects might not need the logic update. This also refers to the use of object classification. Most of the scene object in game might appear to be "Static" or "Non-AI" type of object such as building, grass and trees. These type of objects will be directly benifitted from Geometry instancing, because they are easily batched together.</li>
<li>The scene need some sort of "fast searching" for visibility classification. Using "Quadtree" or "Octree" at this point should help us eliminate the number of occluded objects very fast</li>
<li>However, it's still possible that there will be a huge number of visible objects in front of the camera. This is where we could use the "Distance-base Level of detail" to shave some works off from the distanced objects.</li>
<li> We should be aware of "searching" and "classifying" that could be another performance hoag. The criteria for bucketing objects into different LoD level is very important
<ul>
<li>At the moment, the distance from the camera is the main criteria.</li>
<li>The classification process is most likely the "read-only" process. this task could be possibly done on "Multi threading" if needed.</li>
<li>Animation update could be completely suppressed on the distance objects</li>
<li>Full Detailed Model will represented LoD0, which is used the most expensive "shader" (normal maps, and per pixel lighting).</li>
<li>Pre-processed Progressive mesh is used for LoD1 and 2</li>
<li>Different type of imposter is planned to used for distanced object
<ul>
<li>Geo-imposter is the cloud of imposter can be used instead of progressive meshes</li>
<li>Image imposter, this type of imposter is the low-detaied 2D texture. Rendering them using "Geometry Shader" as particles might help moving more workload onto the GPU.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
According to this, we will carry on our experiments through implementing those above algorithms </div>
