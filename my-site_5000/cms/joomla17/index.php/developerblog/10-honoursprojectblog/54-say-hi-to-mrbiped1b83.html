<p>Loading Skinned-Mesh in Direct3D10 can be an headache. Thanks to all MS genius who decided to remove many useful utility functions, and replace them with the incomplete "SDKMESH" format :(</p>
<p>Well well, I should stop complaining and explain what I've spin my head into. It seems like the demo is used the animated model that is exported from MAX Biped, with the various attachments.</p>
<p>In order to batch the various meshes together, we need to avoid drawing a single mesh as much as possible. Because of this, it becomes a bit more reasonable why they remove many mesh loader functions from DX10 API, so my additional task here is to learn how to build the custom animated mesh loader class which is supposed to working seamlessly under DX10.</p>
<p>According to this, I've spent most time in this week recap my knowledge of skinning, and animation. While I'm writing this topic, the loader class still not yet completed but there's also some interesting things I should noted down</p>
<ul>
<li>it's possible to create a NULLREF DX9 device to help us get the data from X file using DX9 utility functions</li>
<li>skinned mesh is just another mini-spatial structure</li>
<li>a name convention is very important where the data could be extracted more efficiently, so don't forget to talk to your animator.</li>
<li>always export X file into a text format, and read it as a practice </li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully, the animation loader will be finished within this week, so i could spend time on playing and tuning. We shouldn't forget that there's still a questionable performance gap that I need to answer.</p>
<p>A little bit of side story, I start using some of my spare time exploring the COLLADA file format. Since last summer, I've been playing with the COLLADA loader, but never build my own.</p>
<p>Briefly, COLLADA is a XML file containing a scene data (including Physics and Effects). FCOLLADA is a library created by "Feeling Soft" in order to provide an<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> easy</span> access to Collada file. Too bad, I need more FCOLLADA examples, but it's quite hard to find it over the Internet. :(</p> </div>
