<p>This week, I have carried on my research on the Geometry instancing technique. Two weeks ago, it had been one very busy time for me since we had a number of exams and reports to summit (include the proposal of this project). During that time, even I didn't officially update this blog, I have been trying to explore into some modern programming techniques that might help in this and coming projects.</p>
<p>As we already knew, the current technology of gaming machine (including PC) has been insanely increasing their complexity (regarding to the multiple cores design), the area of linear programming is starting to show the insufficient in term of hardware usability. I will leave the topics of "bottlenecks" and "performance analysis" for later, since this is very huge and detailed but very important.</p>
<p>Recently, Intel has released the library that could help us design a better application on multicore processors, called "Intel Threading Building Blocks" (TBB). Briefly, the library has been designed using the technique called "Task Stealing" which a number of threads could be spawned from the unified pool in order to do any defined job. These threads could be automatically controlled from the "scheduler unit", which help us manage the numbers of working threads more efficiently, without touching any low level threads management.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let's get back to our application. The above screenshots could be able to show some progress on our research. Targeting around 100K of animated character, the application manages to execute at 5fps.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The current output looks quite impressive but still have a huge room for improvement. The next step is to integrating the performance analyser for CPU and GPU (Intel VTune and NVidia PerfHUD are in my mind), then learn to read and understanding those profiling tool.</p> </div>
