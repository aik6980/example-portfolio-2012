			<description><![CDATA[<div class="feed-description"><p>In the first week we have been studied the basic of the research process, and also how to the first step to create the reasonable proposal. </p> <p>For myself, I've been looking up for some interesting topics. I tried to focus myself or the graphic programming, which hopefully will be using the latest technology. As far as I concern, rendering any of these complicated scene is the things I'm interested in so far.</p> <ul> <li>Crowd rendering</li> <li><img src="http://media.teamxbox.com/games/ss/1248/full-res/1126549217.jpg" border="0" width="196" height="128" /></li>   <li>Outdoor scene rendering</li>  <li><img src="http://www.antisphere.com/Research/ForestDesc/nuts_automn.jpg" border="0" width="196" height="128" /></li>  </ul></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<div class="feed-description"><p>this is another official meeting with Matt, my project supervisor. The meeting took place in the Cafe area in the union, where we can pick a nice cup of coffee (we both love the coffee break meeting style, so we decided to keep it on like this =D). </p><p>Mainly, we has been going through some general topics about my project plan. I updated my project status, and told him about some research papers, and my DirectX10 framework. According to this, I also asked about the detail and questions that I should prepare for the coming presentation.</p></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<div class="feed-description"><p>This week, pretty much I still practice coding and try to organize my project in the proper way. I decided not to jump into the techniques right away. My plan is to layout some common codes which will be useful for the debugging process.</p><p>I also decide not to use my WIN32 framework and start it over from scratch. There's a lots of good programming concept and codes where the idea come from my summer placement project.</p><p>Here's a few system code I've done this week</p><ul><li>RTTI</li><li>DirectX Renderer framework (DX10 still in progress)</li><li>Events system</li><li>Object serialization</li></ul><p>On my research, I found the prove that the modern game can gain a huge benefit from the geometry instancing technique (AMD paper) where DX10 is considered as the main renderer. Geometry instancing is also be able to use in other situation, in order to speed up the object tessellation (still in my research progress).</p><p>Apart from this, I draw some of my focus onto the scene management technique. Mostly onto the spatial data structure, and how they gonna fit onto the LoD system.</p><p>I still try to find more research papers about the dynamic imposter. Imposter might be able to help reduce the number of rendered geometry, but they are texture memory bounded. Dynamic imposter can consume a huge amount of video memory if we don't have the right strategy on the texture memory management. </p><p>Things that might be worth looking at, in order to solve the texture memory problem</p><ul><li>Mega texture</li><li>Texture atlas </li><li>Spatial data structure (Quad-tree) </li></ul><p><br />In the presentation, I will try to present the techniques that is important on the modern machine, and give out the reason why DX10 is the most suitable API for the latest graphic pipeline (SM4.0)<br />The presentation is not meant to be very technical, but I need to make sure that i can cover all my ground work.</p><p>To do list: </p><ul><li>Finish the 3rd worksheet (What?

			<title>Week 6 : Directx10 cannot be defeated!</title>
			<link><a href="http://my-site">http://my-site</a>:5000/cms/joomla17/index.php/developerblog/10-honoursprojectblog/39-week-6-directx10-cannot-be-defeated</link>

			<description><![CDATA[<div class="feed-description"><p>This week, apart from the daily research routine, I also practically start learning DirectX10 programming. As we already knew, the DX10 architecture has been completely recreated, and most of the D3DX utillity function has been removed from the core package as well.</p><p>By then, it took me sometimes to realize those function hasn't been completely vanished, but they have been moved into DXUT library. [ oh well, thanks DirectX team :( .. ]</p><p>I'm not going to say how I integrate the DXUT with my framework, but it's working eventually. One huge restriction that DX10 users have to concern is that DXUT code is strictly using UNICODE or WCHAR, so be prepare if your app is MultiByte-based since it will not working at all.</p><p>What does the DXUT provide? Is it worth to change all your code to support UNICODE just only that package?</p><p>The answer is unclear. Anyway, here's the list of DXUT functionallity roughly,</p><ul><li>SDKMESH file loader, X file loader</li><li><strike>predefined DX10 intialization</strike></li><li><strike>predefined Camera</strike></li><li>etc.  </li></ul><p>As far as I concerned in my app, since I'm not using the whole DXUT package so most of the DX10 wrapper are busted apart from the 3DModel Loader (Nice!). Anyway, DXUT is the open-source library, so I still benefit from learning their (DirectX people) code organization.</p><p>Note here, I should remind myself about the presentation that going to be placed on next Monday, and here's the update</p><ul><li>Worksheet#3 has been done, still waiting for the feedback</li><li>Draft presentation is ready for my supervisor</li><li>Start working on Worksheet#4</li><li>Have a introductory chat with Andy (and his PS3 chains!)</li><li>Will have a chat with Ruth, Matt and Henry</li><li>Should star writing the project schedule (MS project) </li></ul>So far, it seems like my plan still on its schedule, but it can't be ignore by a sec. Hopefully, I'm not going to be distracted by other coursework, and the Instancing demo will be up by the middle of December.   <p>&nbsp;</p></div>]]></description>

<p>The demo shows how the skinned instancing technique improve an application's rendering performance. From the figure, we can see the boneset that connect to the various meshes, which allows us to vary each instance's look.<br />According to this, I need a test model which should be setup on the same scheme as the demo for further experiment.</p></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<div class="feed-description"><p>The presentation went fine. It seems like I can represent my research question quite well. As far as I can see, the scope of my project is already made clear and solid. From now, I want to create my geometry instancing demo as fast as possible so I will see the next possibility to improve it.</p><p>The Imposter paper is very useful, because it contains the exact technique that I have been looking for. I should be able to finish reading it before the end of this term then start my further research on the image-based rendering.</p><p>I hope CGT will have a new set of DX10 books very soon. It will be a lot safer if I can check their content before I order one for my own.</p><p>Writing the proposal shouldn't be any problem since the project scope and plan have been made clear. It seems like my supervisor also agree on my project schedule, where I'm very glad that I'm on the right track.<br />Anyway, I should try to finish the draft proposal as soon as possible then I will have time to fix and rewrite. This will be done in two weeks from now.     </p></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<div class="feed-description"><p>Gosh, there are so many courseworks waiting for me to do it right now!<br />Feeling a bit sorry that my research on the honour project was on halt this week. Anyway, this doesn't mean I have  stopped programming. =D<br />My networking coursework has gone into a huge blob now since I've tried to redesign my win32/directx framework as well. It actually help me a lot in order to understand the subsystem distributed engine design.</p><p>Last weekend, I tried to change my head around a bit by doing some XNA programming. I found it's surprisingly relaxing, Orz'' when I'm coding in C# instead of C++. Actually, I could use them to create the Louis's Curve coursework mockup. :p<br />.NET technology comes with many useful standard libraries. Honestly, I've been considering to use XNA for my honour project prototype!</p><p>Finally, I shouldn't forget to remind myself that I need to start writing my proposal coursework soon. From my programming pace right now, even looking at the bright side, there will be no chrismas break!! T^T    </p></div>]]></description>

			<title>Week 9 : RARE talks, superbly useful presentation!</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<div class="feed-description"><a href="http://img296.imageshack.us/my.php?image=spritesheetheavyweaponszr6.gif" target="_blank"><img style="margin: 5px 10px; float: left;" src="http://img296.imageshack.us/img296/3214/spritesheetheavyweaponszr6.th.gif" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us" width="119" height="165" /></a>This week we just had the best lecture ever!<br />The lecturer is one of the lead graphic programmer from RARE Games. I'm not quite sure how to spell his fullname, and it will be a bad idea to blindly type it here so I will call him Mr.D.
<p>Mr.D is so awesome! and since I'm so crazy about the game graphic programming, this makes his lecture is uberly useful to me, both of the honours project and personal research PoV.</p>
<p>Briefly, the whole lecture was about the advance full-screen effect, which most of them have already become a standard in modern game applications.<br />Personally, the full-screen effcet is not a new thing to me. I did implement them quite a few times into my past works (Direct3D, GroupProject). I found his lecture's real benefits are where he strongly confirmed most of my understanding are correct. =D</p>
<p>I also noted down some programming tips as following</p>
<ul>
<li>Offline ambient occlusion is still the best solution for most games.<br />around 32-64 rays have been casted from different angles in the offline-authoring tool<br />(Will ask Martin about this!)</li>
<li>Imposters are rendered using the key-color (like below sprite-based image) to exclude the unwanted project area. It use no-blending at all!</li>
<li>Imposters could be a few frames of animation, which the texture atlas technique could be used to store images in spatial-struture form (quad-tree)</li>
<li>Transparency is still a major problem on many effect such as fog.<br />It might sounds expensive, but we could render them again after the effect has been done to make sure we had the correct destination color while blending.</li>
<li>Imposters should be generated with the depth-texture</li>
<li>The great example for "partial-glow" is TRON2.0 the game</li>
<li>Deferred rendering (like deferred shading?) heavily used the fullscreen buffer, and it's memory-bound</li>
</ul></div>]]></description>

			<title>Week 10 : Submitting a drafted proposal</title>
			<link><a href="http://my-site">http://my-site</a>:5000/cms/joomla17/index.php/developerblog/10-honoursprojectblog/47-week-10-submitting-a-drafted-proposal</link>

			<description><![CDATA[<div class="feed-description"><p>My first drafted proposal has been fired off a few ago, and now I'm waiting to hear some feedbacks. Briefly, the proposal has explained all the rendering techniques that I want to explore, including literature reviews, and some background studies. According to these evidences, they should support and make my research looks more convincible more or less.</p>
<p>Prototyping DX10 framework has been slightly changed in plan. Starting with the disposable mockups sounds better since those new techniques might not fit properly in the framework, and I don't want to mess my head up with the whole bulky projects right now.</p>

			<title>Week 11 : Research update</title>
			<link><a href="http://my-site">http://my-site</a>:5000/cms/joomla17/index.php/developerblog/10-honoursprojectblog/48-week-11-research-update</link>

			<description><![CDATA[<div class="feed-description"><p><span style="background-color: #fefefe;">This week, I got a feedback from Matt about the proposal revision. I'm very happy that is no major problem regarding to what he said. At this stage, I believe this proposal should be good enough for the coursework submission.</span><span style="background-color: #fefefe;"><br />At this stage, we again arranged the research meeting to update the research's progress. The aganda has been listed as following,</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="background-color: #fefefe;">Update and discuss about the result on my geometry instancing demo</span></li>
<li><span style="background-color: #fefefe;">Direct3D 10 has "Geometry instancing" as one of the drawing routine! (highly optimized)</span></li>
<li><span style="background-color: #fefefe;">Bezier curves as 3D model? "T<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">essellated Geometry instancing" is the technique I found that can be used to represent the 3D model with dynamic LOD.</span></span></li>
<li>How we gonna measure CPU and GPU performance? VTune and PerfSDK</li>
<li>I think I have a better understanding of Scene Graphs, targeting QuadTree, Loose OcTree</li>
<li>Tasks management, the new design for MultiCore-based Game loop?</li>
<li>Integrating "DevIL", the image manipulator library. Trying to avoid the unexpected performance hit, the library will be used only on the debugging purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm going to talk to Ruth about all above issues as well. There's an interesting result from my geometry instancing demo, where I cannot seem any performance gain on the GPU side.</p>
<p>How's this happened? So far, it seem like the Geometry instancing techniques could help you move the bottleneck from one place to another. Acoording to this, sometimes it's hard to determine by just looking at the screen. This is the reason why the performance graph become more important!<br />Here, my work again has been adding up! I think I need to learn how to use VTune, and PerfSDK. Briefly, those are the performance measureing tools for CPU and GPU.</p>
<p>Ways to go!!</p></div>]]></description>

<p>This week, I have carried on my research on the Geometry instancing technique. Two weeks ago, it had been one very busy time for me since we had a number of exams and reports to summit (include the proposal of this project). During that time, even I didn't officially update this blog, I have been trying to explore into some modern programming techniques that might help in this and coming projects.</p>
<p>As we already knew, the current technology of gaming machine (including PC) has been insanely increasing their complexity (regarding to the multiple cores design), the area of linear programming is starting to show the insufficient in term of hardware usability. I will leave the topics of "bottlenecks" and "performance analysis" for later, since this is very huge and detailed but very important.</p>
<p>Recently, Intel has released the library that could help us design a better application on multicore processors, called "Intel Threading Building Blocks" (TBB). Briefly, the library has been designed using the technique called "Task Stealing" which a number of threads could be spawned from the unified pool in order to do any defined job. These threads could be automatically controlled from the "scheduler unit", which help us manage the numbers of working threads more efficiently, without touching any low level threads management.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let's get back to our application. The above screenshots could be able to show some progress on our research. Targeting around 100K of animated character, the application manages to execute at 5fps.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The current output looks quite impressive but still have a huge room for improvement. The next step is to integrating the performance analyser for CPU and GPU (Intel VTune and NVidia PerfHUD are in my mind), then learn to read and understanding those profiling tool.</p></div>]]></description>

			<title>Week15 : Bottlenecks, learning to live with the limitation</title>
			<link><a href="http://my-site">http://my-site</a>:5000/cms/joomla17/index.php/developerblog/10-honoursprojectblog/51-week15-bottlenecks-learning-to-live-with-the-limitation</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true"><a href="http://my-site">http://my-site</a>:5000/cms/joomla17/index.php/developerblog/10-honoursprojectblog/51-week15-bottlenecks-learning-to-live-with-the-limitation</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<div class="feed-description"><h4>Understanding Bottlenecks<br /></h4>
<p>In an ideal case, there won’t be any one bottleneck—the CPU, AGP bus, and GPU pipeline stages are all equally loaded. Unfortunately, that case is impossible to achieve in real-world applications—in practice, something always holds back performance.</p>
<p>The bottleneck may reside on the CPU or the GPU. PerfHUD’s green shows how many milliseconds the GPU is idle during a frame. If the GPU is idle for even one millisecond per frame, it indicates that the application is at least partially CPU-limited. If the GPU is idle for a large percentage of frame time, or if it’s idle for even one millisecond in all frames and the application does not synchronize CPU and GPU, then the CPU is the biggest bottleneck. Improving GPU performance simply increases GPU idle time.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Another easy way to find out if your application is CPU-limited is to ignore all draw calls with PerfHUD (effectively simulating an infinitely fast GPU).  In the Performance Dashboard, simply press N.  If performance doesn’t change, then you are CPU-limited and you should use a tool like Intel’s VTune or AMD’s CodeAnalyst to optimize your CPU performance.</div>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Bottleneck: GPU</h4>
<p>GPUs are deeply pipelined architectures. If the GPU is the bottleneck, we need to find out which pipeline stage is the largest bottleneck.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">PerfHUD simplifies things by letting you force various GPU and driver features on or off. For example, it can force a mipmap LOD bias to make all textures 2 × 2. If performance improves a lot, then texture cache misses are the</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">bottleneck. PerfHUD similarly permits control over pixel shader execution times by forcing all or part of the shaders to run in a single cycle.<br />PerfHUD also gives you detailed access to GPU performance counters and can automatically find your most expensive render states and draw calls, so we highly recommend that you use it if you are GPU-limited.</div>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Bottleneck: CPU</h4>
<p>Because the goal at this stage is to reduce the CPU overhead so that the CPU is no longer the bottleneck, it is relatively important what consumes the most CPU time. The usual advice applies: choose algorithmic improvements over <br />minor optimizations. And of course, find the biggest CPU consumers to yield the largest performance gains.</p>
<p>PerfHUD also helps to identify driver overhead. It can display the amount of time spent in the driver per frame (plotted as a red line) and it graphs the number of batches drawn per frame.</p>
<h4>Regarding my understanding so far..</h4>
<p>Our main technique "geometry instancing" has been already stated in purpose to turn over the CPU bottleneck by trying to reduce the number of GPU function calls. Anyway, further CPU and GPU information still need to be collected in order to decide what is going to be the next best strategy.</p>
