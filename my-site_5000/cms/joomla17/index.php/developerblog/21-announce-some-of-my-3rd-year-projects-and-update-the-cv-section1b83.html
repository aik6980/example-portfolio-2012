<p><strong>Updated <a href="http://my-site:5000/cms/joomla17/index.php/component/content/?id=3:cv&amp;catid=3:cvcv&amp;Itemid=5">CV section</a></strong><br /><br />I have to admit that this year work is far more busy compares to the first two years in our course. Anyway, since I don't have that much time to update my website, this time I have got many stuffs that I want to share here.</p>
 
<p>First of all, about my summer plan, It's quite bad that I don't think I can fly home to see my family again this year. The good thing is, they are very supportive and will understand , since there're quite some interesting projects that I want to join (this is one of the reason that I need to update the CV) in order to improve my skills and myself =) <br /><br />Definitely a summer job! I found some game companies around Dundee have been offered the good summer placement this year, which I should apply because the real world programming experience is very important to the game programmer. With my current knowledges and my dedication, I hope I can benifit their team in some manner. <br /><br />Secondly, I should try thinking about the team that I want to prepare for Dare to be Digital Competition next year. <br /><br />I also decided to start my little programming community, which I hope it could be a place that we, programmers, can share fun and knowledge. Please take a look by visiting the following link. <a target="_blank" href="http://aik6980.adsl24.co.uk/"><a href="http://aik6980.adsl24.co.uk/">http://aik6980.adsl24.co.uk/</a></a></p></div>
