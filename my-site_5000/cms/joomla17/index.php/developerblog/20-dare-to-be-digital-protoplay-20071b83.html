<p><br />It has been a month, which I was busy working with my GBA tutor on the next term tutorials, that I believe it gonna be my next job. After his approval,the tutorial section in this website might be able to start as well. ;)<br />Besides, I've been working for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.daretobedigital.com/">Dare to be Digital</a> last month in Edinburgh. My responsibility is to show and instruct our event's guests to try some basic game programming using <a target="_blank" href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">SCRATCH software</a>. Basically, it's almost the same job I did before with Henry so I can catch a grip very quickly.</p>
 
It was quite over expected since we had a lot of people come visited everyday. It's about 100 people which is only my section, that make me need to skip my lunch break. Anyway, it's very good fun to help and inspire young schoolkids to create their first game, and that worth it.<br />Edingburgh is very lively and crowed city. I'm very lucky to have this job because it allows meto work and travel in the same time.<br />Finally, the Dare to be digital main event is very amazing, all the final rounded games are high quality. Talking and meeting with many people including professional game programmer have given me a lot of ideas which it is valuable and very useful for my future game. I will gather a good team and enter the competition, which I hope I can do it fast enough while I'm still on fire!!</div>
