<p>
	Even this is my third job as a software developer. However, it&#39;s still very exciting and very refreshing since this is my first job as a programmer in the game industry.<br />
	I have joined RTW gameplay prototyping team, working on My World project. Thr project is an opened world MMO plarform, aiming for a fully customizable world which will be a mixture of user contents and the environment based on the real world data.</p>
 
<p>
	My role is to experiment with various type of data that we can harvest from the internet and see if it is interesting enough to include them in the game. According to this, I have built a basic data mining robot to help me create a data mash-up from the collection of websites based on the game context.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h4>
	learning outcome</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Seriously used of C# and .NET technologies</strong></li>
	<li>
		<strong>SQL Database Programming</strong></li>
	<li>
		<strong>Web Application Programming</strong></li>
	<li>
		<strong>Design Patterns in games, Model-View-Controller usage</strong></li>
	<li>
		<strong>Better understanding of Network Game Programming, MMO Game designs</strong></li>
	<li>
		<strong>Better understanding of Multi-threading in modern game application</strong></li>
	<li>
		<strong>Better understanding of Game Assets/Contents Pipeline Programming</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
	As far as I can say, working in the real professional environment has dramatically improved my working aspects, especially my programming perspective. After the summer placement, my programming quality has been dramatically improved, both of the coding style, and project organization. I could say that I&#39;m pretty keen on maintaing the multiple projects environment using Visual Studio IDE, being a lot more familiar with Perforce, which we used as the sources control package.</p>
<p>
	Be a part of the team is very beneficial where I can learn, see and work along with many experienced programmers on the thinned-line border. There&#39;re so many programming tips and topics that I&#39;ve picked up from the daily discussion and technical meeting which I like to carry on as my personal research or use onto my future projects.</p>
<p>
	Moreover, the project also taught me how to be a better planner, which I learn more about scheduling myself and preparing for any changes that might effect the original plan. This is also included the documentation system, and reporting.</p>

<p>
	As one last thing to say after the placement, I definitely sure that I really want to become part of the game industry, especially on the Engine Development, after I&#39;m graduated. I cannot thank enough for everyone in the company who&#39;s together provide me very great working experience during the whole 3 months I was working over there.</p>
