<div class="art-article"><p>Working 3 months in RTW's summer placement, and moved straight right back to university's final year was very tired!! =D</p> <p>Anyway, my last summer at RTW was one of my very sweet game programming experience. It was very tough, tight and huge amount of pressure on that short assignment. Eventhough, I found it's a funny pleasure that drive forward my programming skills, and improve my coding perspective.<br />I've updated some stories about my summer placement in the completed project section. Don't forget to give it a go.</p><p>The CV section also has been updated. My summer job has been added, including some university activities. Thanks to Henry and other lecturers who allow me to continue my job as the lab demonstrator again for 2009 academic year! =D</p><p>Apart from the regular university's work. Recently, I've started doing some XNA programming. It's strangeningly relaxing as far as I can say. I can see the possibility to use XNA for mocking some courseworks, and may be creating some games at my spare time.</p><p>I've been thinking about using <a href="http://delicious.com/"><a href="http://delicious.com/">http://delicious.com/</a></a> to store my programming online-resources. It's still in question, how I intepret those bookmarks onto some specific pages on my website. (RSS? should try this back home sometimes :D ) </p></div>
