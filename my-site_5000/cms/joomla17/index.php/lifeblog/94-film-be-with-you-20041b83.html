	In my opinion, &quot;Ima, Ai ni Yukimasu&quot; (Be with You), is definitely one of the best Japanese drama film I have ever seen. The story told about love and care in a very clever way through the miracle of a twisted time line. It is a very good mix of many nice moments from romantic feeling-good movies based on their beautiful unbreakable family bonds between the main characters and some good slight bit of super-natural mystery.</p>

	For me, this film is very great. Not only because of their magical touchy story, but also everything else. As I remembered, I love the smart usage of color tones which softly driving the emotion, while so many beautiful scenery shots could easily connect the audience with the movie perceptive. The most important component, the music, I cannot help but to give the opening theme a perfect score. It is a genius work which matched perfectly with this movie. It is very well-explained, where you could just only listen to the music and still be able to draw those beautiful main cause from every scenes out of your memory. I personally love this kind of piano, so this could go into the list of my favorite movie theme for the whole time I could easily say.</p>
<p>
	For a few final words, I just have to to say that I love every aspects of this film, and it surely does its job very well as a tear jerker (I admitted that, I still cry like a baby every time I watch it) but also give me a very big smile afterward :_D. Personally, I could really feel it healing me somehow anytime I had a bad day, so warm, sensible, and yet powerful.</p>
<p>
	If you are looking for a good romantic drama. Don&#39;t forget to pick it up. 11/10, go watch it.</p>
