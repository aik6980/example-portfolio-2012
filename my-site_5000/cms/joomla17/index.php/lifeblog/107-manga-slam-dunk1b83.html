	Today I would love to share the story about one of my favorite manga&nbsp;</div>
 
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Slam Dunk is a 31 Volume Sports manga written by the great Takehiko Inoue. It was created in 1990 to 1996 during the shoen jump, then later adapted into an 101 episode anime by Toei Animation. It has become very famous and Slam Dunk was officially declared in 2007 Japan&#39;s favorite manga.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Not only has it sold more than 100 million copies alone in japan it has even received the Shogakukan Manga Award for shonen. It is very clearly one of Takehiko Inoue&#39;s greatest manga&#39;s.</div>

<h4>
	Story</h4>
<div>
	Hanamichi Sakuragi is an outcast at highschool, a rebel to society. He ocassionally gets into fights and with his power and publicity he becomes leader of a gang. However the only thing Sakuragi cannot get, is a girlfriend. He is so unpopular he has been rejected 50 times! One day he finds out that Haruko Akagi is the girl of his dreams. Haruko, who recognizes Hanamichi&#39;s athleticism, introduces him to the Shohoku basketball team and Hanamichi plays along. Hanamichi was reluctant to join the team at first because he had no previous background in any sports and thought that basketball was a game for losers. Sakuragi, despite his immaturity and hot temper, proves to be a natural athlete with potential and joins the team in order to impress Haruko and prove that he is worthy of her!</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	However Hanamichi has a rival, Kaede Rukawa. He is natural born basketball player and has amazing talent. Hanamichi is a very jealous person and trains very hard to learn the basics of basketball to try and amaze Haruko. In the begginning Hanamichi only learnt basketball to impress Haruko. However after training so hard and playing with the team, he feels motivated and stronger. In the later half of the manga, Hanamichi is no longer known as an outcast but a star player of the Shohoku basketball team! They gather old lost players, and new bright players. Under the command of team captain Takenori Akagi, he dreams of making Shohoku the national champion.</div>

<h4>
	Artwork</h4>
<div>
	Inoue Takehiko, this guy has awesome drawing skills! Although his drawing looks a little quirky when the manga first published but soon his drawing style improved and became much more smooth and neat, pleasant to the eyes after the mid volumes. What really makes me fall in love with Inoue&#39;s drawing is that the characters looks realistic, but not too realistic like Hojo Tsukasa&#39;s. And what sets him aside from the rest of all the famous manga-kas we&#39;ve known is that the beauty of his drawing is so powerful that even though his characters has funny hairsyles and old-fashioned, his amazing drawing skills just pulls everyone&#39;s attention away from that kind of thoughts and makes the manga looks refreshing and new.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	And most notably, Slam Dunk is just full of details thanks to Inoue. Ranging from shades, complicated little backgrounds such as basketball rings, foldings, and even the brand of everyone&#39;s shoes like Nike, Asics, Converse, Adidas. No matter how small the details are, he never misses one, which makes his drawings near perfect</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The characters movements and expressions are so well defined you experience what they are being put through. When they are training hard and sweating or with bleak faces when the team is losing, you experience every feeling and emotion from the characters. When the actions speeds up, the art quality accelarates, nothing is left out at all and the readers knows exactly everything that is going on. Takehiko Inoue&#39;s art makes these things possible and Slam Dunk is a great example of this.</div>
