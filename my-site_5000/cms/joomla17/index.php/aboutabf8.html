<h4>
	Music and Cooking</h4>
<p>
	Outside my coding hours, I also put myself into a few different creation activities. I love playing guitar, and usually find time for a practice session everyday. I also try pushing myself to learn Music theory to be able to better express my own creativity.</p>
<p>
	I like listening a wide range of music, 80s, Japanese pop to Rock/Metal until Jazz and Classical music, even the Video Game music. If I have to pick my favorite one, I prefer Smooth Inspirational Jazz at the top. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Cooking is another one of my things. Learning the theory behind each type of ingredient is very much fun, and it can be surprisingly scientific too. I often pick one or two new materials on my shopping day and try to come up with a new recipe. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h4>
	Internet and Games</h4>
<p>
	I don&#39;t have TV for a very long time now, but the Internet has already been a very good source to keep me up to date. I love watching Documentary, and luckily there are plenty you can find them online.</p>
<p>
	Even it is not as much as before, I still play games, read Japanese Manga&nbsp;and American comics. Personally, they sometimes are the best resources for me to stay sharp, help keeping my imagination on the edge and be able to think outside of the box.</p>
<h4>
	Charity/Voluntary Work</h4>
<p>
	With my little spare time left, I use it for some voluntary works with young people. About my contribution, I do teaching Music and talking about Game Development at schools from time to time.</p>
<p>
	I joined this program&nbsp;because I want to be able to give some back to our society, and share more than just games. As a game developer, I would like to use my profession to help inspiring, mentoring and encouraging our children. I hope this would be benefit for their future somehow. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	... As much as I love turn things into experiments and challenges, this somehow become my favorite quote ...</p>
